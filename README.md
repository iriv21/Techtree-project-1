Guessing Numbers
This program allows the user to guess a random number from 1-100. Each guess that is incorrect, 
the program will let the user know if the guess was too high or low. When the user guesses the correct
random number, the program will display a message and how many attempts the user made for that game 
along with the mean, median, and mode of the game. The program will ask the user if they would like to 
play again. If yes, a new random number will be guessed, if no the program exits with a goodbye message.
